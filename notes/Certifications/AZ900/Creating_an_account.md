# Azure Billing

## Azure subscription

**Azure subscription** - a logical container used to provision resources
in Azure.

You might want to create additional subscriptions to separate:

-   **Environments** - development and testing

-   **Organisational structures** - different departments

-   **Billing** - manage and track costs

You may also need additional subscriptions due to subscription limits as
they have hard limits, such as the max number of Express Route circuits
per subscription is 10.
